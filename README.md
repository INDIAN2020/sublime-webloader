sublime-less-watch
==================

A Sublime 2 plugin to live-update CSS via less.js.

Uses Tornado to start a local http server; websockets to reach the server from the browser; and httplib.HTTPConnection in the plugin to send the server edits.

Still very much in development, but suggestions and fixes are welcome.
